# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### AI-Native Content Development
All content is developed using AI-assisted tools and workflows; Content must be generated iteratively with AI agents, reviewed by human experts, and continuously improved based on feedback and technological advances.

### Modular Academic Structure
Content must be organized in clearly defined, self-contained modules/chapters; Each module should be independently learnable, testable, and updatable; Clear learning objectives and prerequisites required for each module.

### Technical Accuracy and Future-Focused
All technical content must be verified for accuracy against current research and industry standards; Content should anticipate future developments in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics; Forward-looking perspective required.

### Practical Application Focus
Every theoretical concept must have corresponding practical examples, labs, or exercises; Hands-on implementation and experimentation are essential components; Integration with real robotics and AI frameworks required.

### Human-AI Collaboration Centric
Content must emphasize collaboration between humans, AI, and robotic systems; Ethical considerations and human factors must be integrated throughout; Focus on preparing learners for human-AI-robot teaming scenarios.

### Multi-Modal Learning Support
Content must include text, diagrams, code samples, videos, and interactive elements; Support for different learning styles and accessibility requirements; Auto-generated visual aids and interactive components required.

## Technology Stack and Deployment

Built with Docusaurus for documentation; Deployed on GitHub Pages; Version-controlled with Git; AI generation tools: Claude Code/Qwen Code; Diagram generation with tools like Mermaid or Auto-generated images; Code examples in Python, C++, or other relevant languages.

## Development Workflow

Iterative drafting with AI assistance; Content reviewed by subject matter experts; Regular updates based on latest research; Continuous integration for documentation deployment; Peer review process for technical accuracy.

## Governance

All content must follow established academic standards; Technical accuracy verified by domain experts; Regular review cycles for currency of content; Compliance with accessibility standards required.
