# Book YAML Generator

This simple script generates the book.yaml file based on the project constitution and textbook structure.

## Overview
The book.yaml file is the core specification for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This generator ensures that the book.yaml file:
- Incorporates the principles from the project constitution
- Follows the required structure and metadata
- Maintains compatibility with Docusaurus
- Supports the AI-native content development workflow

## Implementation
This generator would typically be implemented as a Node.js script or Python script that:
- Reads the project constitution
- Scans the textbook directory structure
- Generates the appropriate book.yaml file
- Validates it against the required schema
- Ensures all required sections are in the correct order

## Principles Integration
The generator ensures that the generated book.yaml:
- Supports AI-native content development (via integration with Claude Code/Qwen Code)
- Organizes content with modular academic structure
- Ensures technical accuracy and future-focused approach
- Includes practical application focus
- Supports human-AI collaboration centric approach
- Provides multi-modal learning support
