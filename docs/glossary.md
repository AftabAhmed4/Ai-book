# Glossary of Terms

This template provides the structure for the textbook's glossary of terms.

## Format

Each entry follows this structure:

**Term**: Definition

### A

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.

**Autonomous System**: A system that operates independently without direct human control.

### B

**Behavior-Based Robotics**: An approach to robotics that uses modular, task-achieving behaviors to create complex behavior through interaction.

### C

**Cognitive Robotics**: The study of computational principles underlying intelligent behavior in artificial agents.

### D

**Deep Learning**: A subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.

### E

**Embodied AI**: Artificial intelligence that interacts with the physical world through a body or robotic platform.

### F

### G

**General AI**: AI systems that possess the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge in a way indistinguishable from human intelligence across various domains.

### H

**Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**: The field of study focusing on the design, development, and evaluation of robots for human use.
