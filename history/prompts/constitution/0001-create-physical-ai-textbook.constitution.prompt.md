## Prompt

Create a complete AI-native technical textbook for the course Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics, developed using Docusaurus, written through Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code/Qwen Code, and deployed on GitHub Pages.
The textbook must be:

modern, technically accurate, and future-focused

optimized for learners preparing for human–AI–robot collaboration

structured like a full academic course

fully modular, with clean chapter breakdowns

practical, including labs, exercises, diagrams, and glossaries

aligned with real robotics, AI, and agentic systems workflows

Ensure that the book adopts an AI-native development workflow: iterative drafting, auto-generation of diagrams, code samples, algorithm explanations, and hands-on robotics projects.

## Response snapshot

Successfully created a constitution for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project with version 1.0.0, establishing six core principles around AI-native content development, modular academic structure, technical accuracy, practical application focus, human-AI collaboration centricity, and multi-modal learning support.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established foundational principles for AI-native textbook development with specific focus on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics education
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: none
- 🧠 Reflection: Creating a tailored constitution for an educational textbook project required adapting general software development principles to pedagogical and content creation contexts
