## Prompt

Using the Constitution and the Spec-Kit Plus Specification (book.yaml) for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook, generate a complete and professional Development Plan for building the entire AI-native textbook.
The plan must be practical, actionable, and aligned with a modern AI-assisted publishing workflow.

Your Development Plan must include the following structured sections:

## Response snapshot

Completed the implementation planning workflow for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook, creating plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, and API contracts for textbook content management.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive development plan with research, data models, contracts, and quickstart guide for AI-native textbook
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: specs/master/plan.md, specs/master/research.md, specs/master/data-model.md, specs/master/quickstart.md, specs/master/contracts/textbook-api.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: none
- 🧠 Reflection: Implementation planning successfully created all necessary artifacts for textbook development following AI-native workflows
