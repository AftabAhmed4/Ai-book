## Response snapshot

## Feature Specification Completed

The feature specification for the RAG-Based Chatbot for Educational Content has been successfully created with the following details:

- **Branch Name**: `002-rag-chatbot-agent`
- **Spec File Path**: `D:\aftab\hackathon\specs\002-rag-chatbot-agent\spec.md`
- **Checklist Path**: `D:\aftab\hackathon\specs\002-rag-chatbot-agent\checklists\requirements.md`

### Summary of Completed Work:

1. Created the feature branch `002-rag-chatbot-agent` based on the feature description
2. Developed a comprehensive specification following the template structure
3. Identified and addressed key user scenarios and testing requirements
4. Created functional requirements and success criteria
5. Validated the specification against quality criteria and resolved all issues
6. Created and completed a quality checklist to ensure specification readiness

### Specification Highlights:

The specification describes a RAG-based chatbot that allows users to ask natural language questions about book content and receive accurate, contextual answers. The system provides both a conversational interface for interactive learning and an API for integration with other applications.

The specification is now ready to move to the next phase (`/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`). All validation criteria have been met, implementation details have been removed, and the specification is written for non-technical stakeholders while focusing on user value and business needs.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a complete feature specification for a RAG-based chatbot that meets user needs for accessing book content via natural language queries
- 🧪 Tests: null
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements.md checklist in the 002-rag-chatbot-agent feature directory
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.clarify or /sp.plan to proceed with clarification or planning
- 🧠 Reflection: The specification process followed the template correctly and addressed all required sections while removing implementation details as per requirements
