## Implementation Plan Completed

The implementation planning for the RAG-Based Chatbot for Educational Content has been successfully completed with the following artifacts generated:

- **Branch**: `002-rag-chatbot-agent`
- **Implementation Plan**: `D:\aftab\hackathon\specs\002-rag-chatbot-agent\plan.md`
- **Research Summary**: `D:\aftab\hackathon\specs\002-rag-chatbot-agent\research.md`
- **Data Model**: `D:\aftab\hackathon\specs\002-rag-chatbot-agent\data-model.md`
- **API Contracts**: `D:\aftab\hackathon\specs\002-rag-chatbot-agent\contracts\chat-api.yaml`
- **Quickstart Guide**: `D:\aftab\hackathon\specs\002-rag-chatbot-agent\quickstart.md`
- **Agent Context**: Updated in `D:\aftab\hackathon\QWEN.md`

### Summary of Implementation Plan:

The plan details a RAG-based chatbot implementation that allows users to ask natural language questions about book content and receive accurate, contextual answers. The system uses Qdrant for vector storage, integrates with both OpenAI and Gemini APIs for response generation, and provides a FastAPI endpoint for the chat functionality.

The architecture follows the project's constitution by maintaining an AI-native approach, modular structure, technical accuracy, practical application focus, human-AI collaboration, and multi-modal learning support.

### Key Technical Decisions:

1. **Technology Stack**: Python 3.11, FastAPI, Qdrant, OpenAI SDK, Google Generative AI SDK
2. **Architecture**: Web application with separate backend service and frontend integration
3. **Data Model**: Includes BookContent, UserQuery, ChatSession, AIResponse, and VectorEmbedding entities
4. **API Design**: RESTful API with comprehensive endpoints for chat functionality and session management

The implementation plan is now ready to proceed to the task breakdown phase (`/sp.tasks`).

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the RAG-based chatbot with all required design artifacts and documentation
- 🧪 Tests: null
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts/chat-api.yaml, and updated QWEN.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.tasks to break down implementation into specific tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: The implementation plan thoroughly addresses the requirements from the feature specification and aligns with the project constitution

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Not applicable for planning phase
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Not applicable
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation by executing the tasks generated by /sp.tasks
